# <p align="center"> Terraform CDN Module </p> 



<img alt="GitHub tag (latest SemVer)" src="https://img.shields.io/github/v/tag/Ahmed-Amine-Soltani/terraform-gcp-cdn">





This modules makes it easy to host a static website on Cloud Storage bucket for a domain you own behind a CDN .



The ressources that will be created in your project:

- An external IP address  [link](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/resources/compute_global_address) [link](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/ip-addresses/reserve-static-external-ip-address#reserve_new_static) .

- An entry in Cloud DNS to map the IP address to the domain name [link](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/resources/dns_record_set) [link](https://cloud.google.com/dns/docs/tutorials/create-domain-tutorial#set-up-domain) .
- A GCS bucket [link](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/resources/storage_bucket) [link](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/hosting-static-website) .
- A https external load balancer with CDN  [link](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/resources/compute_global_forwarding_rule) [link](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/https) .
- A http external load balancer to redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS  [link](https://cloud.google.com/cdn/docs/setting-up-http-https-redirect#partial-http-lb) .
- A managed certificate for HTTPS [link](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/resources/compute_managed_ssl_certificate) [link](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/ssl-certificates/google-managed-certs) .





### Usage

------

You can go to the examples folder, however the usage of the module could be like this in your own main.tf file:

```hcl
module "cdn" {
  source  = "Ahmed-Amine-Soltani/cdn/gcp"
  version = "2.0.0"
  dns_name                     = "example"
  google_dns_managed_zone_name = "my-google-dns-managed-zone-name"
  google_storage_bucket_name   = "example.bucket.mydnsname.com"
  folder_path                  = "/path/to/your/folder"
}
```



Then perform the following commands on the root folder:

- `terraform init` to get the plugins.
- `terraform plan` to see the infrastructure plan.
- `terraform apply` to apply the infrastructure build.
- `terraform destroy` to destroy the built infrastructure.

### Requirements

------

Before starting youâ€™ll need some pre-existing configurations:

- An existing GCP account linked to a billing account.
- An existing GCP project.
- A service account with a key.
- Terraform installed and configured on your machine.
- A domain name managed in Cloud DNS (Public Zone).
- Domain named bucket [verification](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/domain-name-verification) .
- Some files to upload to the bucket , least an index page `index.html`and a 404 page `404.html`.
- [gsutil](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil_install) command-line tool.

In order to operate with the Service Account you must activate the following APIs on the project where the Service Account was created:

- Cloud DNS API
- Compute Engine API

### Service account roles to add 

------

- Compute Admin          

- Compute Load Balancer Admin          

- DNS Administrator          

- CA Service Operation Manager          

- Storage Admin
